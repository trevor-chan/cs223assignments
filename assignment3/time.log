The most challenging aspects of this assignment for me were writing the add point and merge functions, as well as the heat map wraparound case. Addpoint and merge were difficult as my initial memory allocation and indexing was always slightly off, which resulted in a lot of memory leaks. Additionally, I was confused at first when initialization of a value should first take place (e.g. when a segment is created, should the first tracepoint be allocated but not initialized until add point is called?) The heat map function was fairly straightforward, except for the wrap case, which took some thinking to figure out. I ended up finding the largest gap between consecutive longitudes of points and comparing that to the distance wrapping around the -180/180 meridian to determine whether an inversion was necessary.
