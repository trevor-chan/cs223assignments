Didn’t talk to anyone else outside of office hours

For the first while of writing the program, I didn’t know how to test it or access the public cases, so it was really helpful when I went to office hours and figured out how that works. Other than that, I was using scanf instead of getchar for a while, which I now realize was a terrible idea. It caused a lot of the invalid cases to fail, but I think I have that mostly ironed out now. Also, I’ve never really tried to test edge cases for a cs assignment, so I’m sure I’ve missed a lot. Maybe I’ll get better at that as the semester goes on…
