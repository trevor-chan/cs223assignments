Did not talk to anyone or attend office hours

Actually writing the hash table was pretty straightforward, although I ran into a lot of problems when it came to implementing it correctly in the blotto program. The structure of the blotto program is straightforward, but what to allocate, what to pass as a pointer, etc to put, what get() returns, and when to free memory was confusing and took some time to understand.
